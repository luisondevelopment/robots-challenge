# robots-challenge

The code challenge was very fun!  

Unfortunately, I lost a lot of time to understand that the robot should ignore the command only when it fell and not when it touched a point on the map where another robot had already been before it fell.
Because of that, my solution time was around 5 hours.
  
I hope the code is ok and you like it!
   
Thanks! (:
